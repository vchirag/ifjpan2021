On the fwe02.ifj.edu.pl computer, in the directory /home/people/batkiewicz/t2k/data/ppss2021
there are MC data you should use:

mc_small.root - small sample of MC data for tests with interactions only inside the ND280 detector
magnet.root - big sample of MC data with interactions only inside the ND280 detector
sand.root - sample of MC data with interactions *outside of* the ND280 detector, i.e. in surrounding walls/ground/sand ...
mc_big.root - big sample of full MC data with interactions both inside and outside of the ND280 detector (should be more or less the same as real data)


You can test the drawing program first on mc_small.root and then make a plots on bigger statistics from mc_big.root.

Task 2:
===========================================

Warning1: for all tracks make sure they have part in the studied sub-detector (obj_tpc_nnodes > 0 for the part in TPC, obj_ecal_nhits for the part in ECal, obj_fgd_nhits for the part in FGD)

The goal of this task would be select numuCC1pi+ interactions (interactions of muon neutrinos in which 1mu- and 1pi+ and 0 or 1 proton is produced) with the interaction vertex in FGD1 Fiducial Volume (FV).

0. The root files contain "preselected" sample, i.e. sample of interaction in which mu- candidate was selected (selmu_.. track).
   selmu track properties are also saved in obj_.. array in obj_...[obj_maintrack_index].

Warning2: While making below plots, skip muon candidate (obj_...[obj_maintrack_index]) track!

1. Draw distance to muon candidate (obj_tomudist) for tracks from the same neutrino interaction as muon candidate (obj_issamevtx==1) and for tracks from other vertices (obj_issamevtx==0). Distance is in mm.
   Can you see a peak near 0?
2. Draw distance to muon candidate (obj_tomudist) for tracks from the same neutrino interaction as muon candidate (obj_issamevtx==1) for charged pions, protons, electrons, positrons, neutrons and other particles.
   Do they all start near the muon track start position?
   What would be a good cut on obj_tomudist to choose charged pion and proton tracks from the same vertex?
3. Draw (on separate plots) in range [-5;5] distributions of obj_tpc_elpidpull, obj_tpc_prpidpull, obj_tpc_pipidpull
   for muons, antimuons, charged pions (pi+ and pi- separately), electrons, positrons, protons and other particles (all other particles together)
   for objects with at least 18 hits in TPC (obj_tpc_nnodes) and start position (obj_posstart) in FGD1 FV and close to selmu track (obj_tomudist cut)
   separately for tracks reconstructed as positive and as negative tracks (obj_tpc_q==1 and obj_tpc_q==-1).
   What would be a good cut to select pi+ track and proton track
4. If there is part in ECal, draw obj_ecal_mipem for chosen pi+ and proton track
5. Draw the momentum (obj_mom) of chosen pi+ and proton track
6. Using cuts on reconstructed information (don't cut on obj_pdg nor obj_issamevtx) choose interactions with one pi+ candidate and zero or one proton candidate with part in TPC from the same vertex as muon candidate
6a. For such events draw momentum (obj_mom) of pi+ candidate and proton candidate for different true particle types (obj_pdg): true mu-,mu+,pi-,pi+,e-,e+,p,other
6b. For such events draw muon candidate momentum (selmu_mom) and neutrino energy (nu_trueE)  for different primary neutrino reaction types (reaction) and different type of reactions defined based on final state particles (topology) - see default_tree_description.h file for description of reaction and topology variables.
