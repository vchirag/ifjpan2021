On the fwe02.ifj.edu.pl computer, in the directory /home/people/batkiewicz/t2k/data/ppss2021
there are MC data you should use:

mc_small.root - small sample of MC data for tests with interactions only inside the ND280 detector
magnet.root - big sample of MC data with interactions only inside the ND280 detector
sand.root - sample of MC data with interactions *outside of* the ND280 detector, i.e. in surrounding walls/ground/sand ...
mc_big.root - big sample of full MC data with interactions both inside and outside of the ND280 detector (should be more or less the same as real data)


You can test the drawing program first on mc_small.root and then make a plots on bigger statistics from mc_big.root.

Task 1:
===========================================

Warning: for below tracks make sure they have part in TPC (obj_tpc_nnodes > 0)
1. Draw the distribution of obj_tpc_mupidpull for muons, antimuons, charged pions (pi+ and pi- separately), electrons, positrons, protons and other particles (all other particles together)
2. Draw the distribution of obj_tpc_elpidpull for muons, antimuons, charged pions (pi+ and pi- separately), electrons, positrons, protons and other particles (all other particles together)
3. Draw the distribution of obj_tpc_prpidpull for muons, antimuons, charged pions (pi+ and pi- separately), electrons, positrons, protons and other particles (all other particles together)
4. Draw the distribution of obj_tpc_pipidpull for muons, antimuons, charged pions (pi+ and pi- separately), electrons, positrons, protons and other particles (all other particles together)
5. Draw distributions 1-4 for objects with at least 18 hits (obj_tpc_nnodes) (hit is "reconstructed point" in the detector, track and cascade is made of many hits, the longer track and the larger cascade the more hits it contains)
6. Draw distributions 1-4 for objects with at least 18 hits (obj_tpc_nnodes) for tracks starting inside FGD1 Fiducial Volume (obj_posstart, see below) separately for tracks reconstructed as positive and as negative tracks (obj_tpc_q)
