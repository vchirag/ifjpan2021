Task 3: efficiency, purity & kinematic distributions
===========================================

0. The goal of this selection is to choose topology==1: CC-1#pi^{+} 
   At this point you should have selected numuCC1pi+ candidates with neutrino interaction vertex in FGD1 FV.
   There should be two "sub-samples" of such events:
   a) with proton, so that tracks produced in the vertex are: mu- (selmu_...), pi+, proton
   b) without proton, so that tracks produced in the vertex are: mu- (selmu_...), pi+
   Prepare below plots for these events.

1. For selected C1pi+ candidates after all cuts: draw momentum (obj_mom) of pi+ candidate (pepare three plots for all selected events, only for subsample a, only for subsample b) and proton candidate (only subsample b) for different true particle types (obj_pdg): true pi+, proton, mu+/-, pi-,e+/-, other

   What is the background? What do you think, why it was not rejected?
after all cuts: draw muon candidate momentum (selmu_mom[0]) for different true particle types (particle, see default_tree_description.h): true mu-, pi+/-, proton, e+/-, other

2. For selected C1pi+ candidates 
3. For selected C1pi+ candidates after all cuts: draw muon candidate momentum (selmu_mom) and neutrino energy (nu_trueE) for different reaction (reaction = primary neutrino reaction type) and topologies (topology = reaction type based on particles leaving the nucleus)

4. For selected C1pi+ candidates after all cuts for topology==1 (CC-1#pi^{+}) draw neutrino energy (nu_trueE) for different reaction types

   It is expected that such topology will be produced mainly in RES primary neutrino interaction (resonance pion production). Is this true? What else primary neutrino reaction can produce such a topology?

5. Draw purity of the muon, pi+ and proton selection with respect to they momentum,
   Purity: e.g. for pi+ draw the ratio between selected true pi+ number to number of all selected pi+ candidates in each momentum bin, etc.

6. Draw purity of the muon, pi+ and proton selection with respect to they cos theta (theta is the angle between track direction and neutrino beam diraction):
   for muon candidate: selmu_costheta[0], for pi+ and proton candidate obj_dir[particle][2]

5-6: Is there any dependance between purity and particle momentum or cos theta? If yes, what do you think, why is like?

7. Draw purity and efficiency of CC-1#pi^{+} (topology==1) selection for neutrino vertex in FGD1 FV as a function of neutrino energy (nu_trueE)
   Signal reaction: true CC-1#pi^{+} (topology==1) with neutrino vertex in FGD1 FV (infv==1)
   Purity: ratio between number of selected signal reactions to number of all selected reactions in each nu_trueE bin
   Efficiency: ratio between number of *selected* signal reactions to number of all (selected or not) signal reactions in each nu_trueE bin

   Is the purity & efficiency distribution flat or is there any dependence? If yes, what do you think, why is like?

8. For subsample b, draw the invariant mass of the sum of pi+ and proton 4-momentum.
   Draw this distribution for the following three categories:
   - topology==1 (CC-1#pi^{+}) && reaction==1 (RES, resonance pion production)
   - topology==1 (CC-1#pi^{+}) && reaction!=1
   - topology!=1

   What are the differences between those plots? Why?

9. Try to *reconstruct* neutrino energy separately for subsample a) and b) and compare it with true neutrino energy (nu_trueE):

   If you don't know it from root excercises, below there are hints how to calculate it:
   reconstructed momentum (mom) value (not a vector) for different tracks is selmu_mom or obj_mom
   reconsructed direction is selmu_dir or obj_dir
   reconstructed momentum vector is a vector pararell to the direction but with lenght equal to reconstructed momentum value (cern root TVector class is useful here)
   reconstructed total energy E: E^2 = mom^2 + mass^2
   reconstructed 4-monetum: 4-vector or in root TLorentzVector( reconstructed momentum vector, reconstructed total energy )
   (Actually you don't need to calculate total energy if you use method SetXYZM from https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLorentzVector.html)

9.1. Calculate reconstructed neutrino 4-momentum as a sum of mu- and pi+ reconstucted  4-momenta for subsample a) or a sum of mu-, pi+ and proton reconstucted 4-momenta for subsample b). Reconstructed neutrino energy would be E() of this 4-momentum

9.2. Draw (separately for subsample a and b) 2D plot: nu_trueE vs reconstructed neutrino energy
   In ideal case this plot should be diagonal. Is it like that?
   Draw this plot only for true signal events (topology==1)
   Is it better now?
   Draw this plot only for background (topology!=1)
   How it looks like now? Why?

9.3 Draw (separately for subsample a and b) transverse momentum Pt() of the reconstructed neutrino 4-momentum for different reactions and topologies.
  In ideal case it should be zero (neutrino beam is along Z-axis). Is it like that?
   Draw this plot only for true signal events (topology==1)
   Is it better now?
   Draw this plot only for background (topology!=1)
   How it looks like now? Why?
